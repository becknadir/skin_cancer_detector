The dataset is approximately 5GB in size and is not included in this repository due to size limitations. It will be provided separately.

## Directory Structure

Expected structure once dataset is added:

```
data/
    train/
        benign/
            img1.jpg
            img2.jpg
            ...
        malignant/
