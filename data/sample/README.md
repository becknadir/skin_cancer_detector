# Sample Images

This directory contains a few sample skin lesion images to test the model's prediction functionality without requiring the full dataset.

## Usage

To use these sample images for testing:

```
python src/predict.py --model_path models/model_name.h5 --image data/sample/sample_image.jpg --visualize
```

## Note

These sample images are provided for testing purposes only and should not be used for training or validating the model.

## Sample Image Sources

The sample images would be sourced from publicly available skin lesion datasets with appropriate licensing. Sources will be properly credited here once sample images are added.
