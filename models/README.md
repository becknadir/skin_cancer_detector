# Models Directory

This directory is intended to store trained models for skin cancer detection.

## Model Files

After training, this directory will contain files such as:

- `skin_cancer_model.h5`: The main trained model file
- `model_history.pkl`: Training history data
- Other model checkpoints and metadata

## Using Pre-trained Models

If pre-trained models become available, they will be shared separately due to file size limitations.

## Model Performance

Performance metrics of trained models will be documented here once available.
